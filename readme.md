# Snake Game On The Desktop

Some small project i made, just for fun

this is the non-malicious version which is for showcase, so it won't erase your Master Boot Record if you loose =]

also this doesn't use ANY C RUNTIME functions, anything you see is either from the windows api or written by me




# How To Compile

First of all, if you don't have it yet install the Native x64 Build Tools For Visual Studios 2022

then clone this repository somewhere in your computer

after that, go to search and find the x64 Native Tools Command Prompt For VS2022

when you do that go to the directory where you cloned the source in, then run make.bat

after that enjoy!
